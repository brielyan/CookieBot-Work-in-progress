This is a work-in-progress automation project for Cookie Clicker, built with Python and Selenium.

The idea behind this project is simple:
learn how browser automation really works when things are not perfect.

The bot is able to open the game, handle the initial setup, and keep clicking and buying buildings automatically. The CAPTCHA step still needs to be solved manually, but once that’s done, the automation runs without issues. Many parts of the script are adjustable, such as how long it runs and how aggressive the clicking and buying behavior is.

Some features are still incomplete.
The upgrade-buying logic, for example, is under development and doesn’t always work as expected. Because of that, the project may present bugs or inconsistent behavior, especially during long runs.

This project is mainly a learning experiment, where I’m exploring Selenium, dynamic web pages, JavaScript-driven games, and how to combine automation with manual control when needed.
